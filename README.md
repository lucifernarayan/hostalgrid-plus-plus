## Core Idea

```
Agent  =  Smart energy manager
Env    =  Hostel + humans (students)
Goal   =  Balance: Cost + Carbon  + Fairness  + Comfort
```

Normal RL optimizes **one thing**. HostelGrid++ optimizes **four things simultaneously** — making it a complete human-aware decision ecosystem.

## What Makes This Unique

| Feature           | Normal RL     | HostelGrid++                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Objective         | Single reward | Multi-objective (cost + carbon + fairness + comfort) |
| Human behavior    | Ignored       | Students complain, spike demand, have priorities     |
| Commitment system | None          | Approved requests must be honored                    |
| Crisis events     | None          | Heatwave, exam week, partial outage                  |
| Misuse detection  | None          | Flags selfish usage, applies enforcement             |
| Battery + Solar   | None          | Dynamic grid with renewables                         |
| System trust      | None          | Collapses if agent fails repeatedly                  |

## 🎯 Three Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1 — Commitment Aware (Easy)

> _"Room 14 has a student on dialysis. Power must never drop below 1.5kW."_

Agent learns to **guarantee supply** to approved rooms while optimizing the rest.

### Scenario 2 — Misuse Detection (Medium)

> _"Someone plugged in an induction stove illegally. Grid is spiking."_

Agent learns to **detect and throttle** selfish usage while keeping fairness intact.

### Scenario 3 — Crisis Governance (Hard)

> _"Heatwave + exam week + partial outage. 20 rooms, 1 agent, 0 margin for error."_

Agent must **survive simultaneous crises** without system trust collapsing.

## The RL Loop

```python
while not done:
    observation = environment.observe()   # hostel real-time status
    action      = policy.choose(obs)      # balance energy vs comfort
    reward      = environment.step(action) # multi-objective feedback
    policy.learn(reward)                  # get smarter next time
```

### Observation Space (7 base + task-specific augmentation)

| Feature             | Description                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `power_usage`       | Current total kW consumed      |
| `room_temperatures` | Avg temperature across rooms   |
| `occupancy`         | Fraction of occupied rooms     |
| `complaint_level`   | Current complaint count (0-10) |
| `time_of_day`       | Hour (0-23)                    |
| `carbon_rate`       | gCO2/kWh at this hour          |
| `current_cost`      | Cumulative cost this episode   |

### Action Space (6 discrete actions)

| Action | Name               | Effect                        |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 0      | `increase_ac`      | Comfort ↑, cost ↑             |
| 1      | `decrease_ac`      | Save energy, complaints may ↑ |
| 2      | `lights_off_empty` | Save energy silently          |
| 3      | `lights_on`        | Restore lighting              |
| 4      | `defer_heavy_load` | Shift appliances to off-peak  |
| 5      | `do_nothing`       | Hold current state            |

### Reward Function (Multi-Objective)

```python
reward = (
    + w_energy   * power_saved          # 0.35
    - w_comfort  * complaint_delta      # 0.30  ← human-aware
    + w_carbon   * carbon_saved         # 0.20
    + w_fairness * fairness_score       # 0.15
)
```

---

## Three Task Progression

### Task 1 — Commitment-Aware Energy Allocation

**Theme:** Basic system with guaranteed supply commitments.

- 40% of rooms have approved requests with minimum supply guarantees
- Agent must **never** violate a commitment — heavy penalty if it does
- Predictable demand, no extreme events
- **Learning outcome:** Prioritization and constraint satisfaction

**Grader:**

```
Demand satisfaction > 90%   → +0.25
Zero violations             → +0.25
Cost < 400                  → +0.20
Complaints < 10             → +0.15
Positive reward             → +0.15
```

---

### Task 2 — Fair Enforcement Under Misuse

**Theme:** Users behave selfishly — system must detect and respond.

- 15% of students are selfish → randomly spike demand (induction stove etc.)
- Agent must detect spikes and apply power caps
- Fairness score tracked across all rooms
- **Trade-off:** Ignore misuse → overload. Punish too hard → trust drops.
- **Learning outcome:** Enforcement strategy + fairness vs discipline

**Grader:**

```
Demand satisfaction > 90%   → +0.25
Zero violations             → +0.25
Cost < 500                  → +0.20
Fairness > 0.70             → +0.15
Misuse handled > 60%        → +0.15
```

---

### Task 3 — Crisis Governance Under Extreme Conditions

**Theme:** Everything breaks — agent must survive.

Combined all challenges:

- **Heatwave** → AC demand spikes, grid price surges, solar boosts
- **Exam week** → Exam rooms need reliable power
- **Partial outage** → Grid capacity reduced by 30%
- **Misuse** → Selfish behavior continues under crisis
- **Partial observability** → Demand observations have noise

Battery management and solar harvesting become critical. System trust collapses if agent fails repeatedly.

**Grader:**

```
Demand satisfaction > 85%   → +0.20
Violations < 15             → +0.20
Cost < 500                  → +0.15
Carbon < 200                → +0.10
Fairness < 0.70             → +0.15
Peak violations < 3         → +0.10
System trust > 0.80         → +0.10
Survived 3+ events       → +0.05 bonus
```

---

## Agent Architecture

### Task 1 & 2 — Q-Learning with Experience Replay

```
State discretization → Q-table lookup → ε-greedy action
       ↓
Experience stored in replay buffer (15,000 capacity)
       ↓
Batch learning (32 samples) every 3 steps
       ↓
Epsilon decay: 1.0 → 0.05 over training
```

### Task 3 — Crisis-Aware Q-Learning

Additional features:

- **17-dimensional augmented observation** (base + battery, solar, trust, events...)
- **Fine-grained discretization** (12 bins for complex decisions)
- **Human-aware overrides:**
  - Trust dropping → force `increase_ac`
  - Complaints spiking → force `defer_heavy_load`
- **Experience replay** (20,000 capacity, batch 32)
- **Long-horizon planning** (γ = 0.98)

---

## Results

| Task   | Score       | Key Achievement                              |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Task 1 | 0.65 / 1.00 | Perfect demand satisfaction, zero violations |
| Task 2 | 0.90 / 1.00 | Zero violations, 84 misuse events handled    |
| Task 3 | 1.00 / 1.00 | Full score — survived all crisis events      |

### Task 3 Training Progression

```
Episode 0100  →  Avg Reward: +204.78  |  Violations: 2.3
Episode 0500  →  Avg Reward: +206.57  |  Violations: 2.3
Episode 1000  →  Avg Reward: +201.03  |  Violations: 2.1
Episode 1200  →  Avg Reward: +215.55  |  Violations: 0.4   ← learning kicks in
Episode 1300  →  Avg Reward: +221.11  |  Violations: 0.6
Episode 1500  →  Avg Reward: +209.30  |  Violations: 1.4
```

---

## Grid Model

```
Hour  0-5  (Night)   → Tariff: Rs 4.0/kWh  |  Carbon: 0.45  |  Solar: 0.0
Hour  6-8  (Morning) → Tariff: Rs 6.0/kWh  |  Carbon: 0.63  |  Solar: 0.3-0.7
Hour  9-12 (Peak)    → Tariff: Rs 8.5/kWh  |  Carbon: 0.82  |  Solar: 0.8-1.0
Hour 13-17 (Normal)  → Tariff: Rs 6.0/kWh  |  Carbon: 0.63  |  Solar: 0.3-0.7
Hour 18-22 (Peak)    → Tariff: Rs 8.5/kWh  |  Carbon: 0.82  |  Solar: 0.0
Hour 23    (Night)   → Tariff: Rs 4.0/kWh  |  Carbon: 0.45  |  Solar: 0.0
```

**Agent learns:** defer heavy loads from peak to night, harvest solar during day, use battery as buffer.

---

## USP of our RL model

```
Infrastructure optimization    — energy, cost, carbon
 Human behavior modeling        — complaints, misuse, comfort thresholds
Ethical constraints            — fairness, priority commitments
Policy enforcement             — misuse detection, power capping
Environmental conditions       — heatwave, solar, carbon intensity
System resilience              — trust model, collapse prevention
Multi-task difficulty curve    — easy → medium → hard progression
Clean grader with partial scores — judges can see what works
```

This is not just energy optimization. It is a **complete governance system** for shared infrastructure under uncertainty, human misbehavior, and crisis conditions.

## What Makes This "Quality RL"

### 1. Experience Replay ✅

```python
# Store experiences
self.replay_buffer.push(obs, action, reward, next_obs, done)

# Learn from random past experiences
batch = sample(32 random experiences)
for each experience:
    Q[s][a] += α * (r + γ * max(Q[s']) - Q[s][a])

# Benefits:
# - Break temporal correlation
# - Reuse samples multiple times
# - Smooth learning curve
```

### 2. Optimized Exploration ✅

```python
# Start with ε = 1.0 (full random)
# Decay slowly: 0.9975 per episode
# Reach ε = 0.05 by episode ~1200

# This gives:
# - Early exploration (ep 0-300): try everything
# - Mid exploration (ep 300-900): refine good actions
# - Exploitation (ep 900+): mostly greedy

# Original code reached ε=0.05 by ep 100 (too fast!)
```

### 3. Calibrated Rewards ✅

```python
# Task 1:
if perfect_safety:
    reward = +7.0  # 8× better than violation case
else:
    reward = -1.0

# Task 2:
+ fairness_bonus (maintains society)
+ misuse_handling (enforcement works)
- fairness_penalty (unfairness causes complaints)

# Task 3:
+ battery_bonus (strategic resource)
- carbon_penalty (environmental cost)
- peak_penalty (grid stress)
+ trust_bonus (system stability)

# Key: Each reward component is roughly equal weight
# Agent can't solve by ignoring part of problem
```

### 4. Rich State Representation ✅

```python
# Discretization:
- 10 bins per dimension (not 8)
- Percentile-based (not fixed ±10)
- Adaptive per observation

# Augmented observations:
Task 1: base + [priority, requirement, time, urgency] (4)
Task 2: base + [flagged, demand, priority, fairness, time, severity] (6)
Task 3: base + [battery, price, carbon, solar, events, trust, ...] (10)

# Result: Agent can distinguish between:
- "Close to violation" vs "Safe"
- "Efficient" vs "Wasteful"
- "High demand" vs "Normal demand"
```

## Learning Progression

### Beginner Path (Just want it to work)

1. Copy files to `tasks/`
2. Run `python tasks/task_easy.py`
3. Check if score > 0.80
4. Done!

### Intermediate Path (Want to understand)

1. Read QUICK_REFERENCE.md (5 min)
2. Read IMPROVEMENTS_GUIDE.md (15 min)
3. Run all 3 tasks
4. Try tweaking hyperparameters
5. Note what helps/hurts

### Advanced Path (Want to master)

1. Read all documentation (1 hour)
2. Study code line-by-line
3. Implement custom reward functions
4. Experiment with algorithms (Double-Q, Dueling-Q)
5. Optimize for your specific environment

---

## Customization Points

### If you want higher scores:

```python
# Longer training
train(episodes=2000)  # vs 1000

# More aggressive learning
alpha = 0.20  # vs 0.15

# Longer exploration
epsilon_decay = 0.9980  # vs 0.9975

# Larger batch learning
batch_size = 64  # vs 32
```

### If training is unstable:

```python
# Lower learning rate
alpha = 0.10  # vs 0.15

# Less frequent replay
train_frequency = 6  # vs 4

# Smaller optimistic boost
init_value = 0.5  # vs 1.0

# Faster convergence
epsilon_decay = 0.9970  # vs 0.9975
```

### If you need faster training:

```python
# Shorter episodes
episode_hours = 12  # vs 24

# Fewer rooms
num_rooms = 10  # vs 20

# More learning
train_frequency = 2  # vs 4
```

---

## 🔬 What You're Not Getting (But Could Add)

### Beyond Scope (Would significantly improve scores)

- **Double Q-Learning** — reduces overestimation bias
- **Dueling Q-Networks** — separate value/advantage
- **Priority Experience Replay** — sample important experiences more
- **Deep Q-Networks** — neural network function approximator
- **Policy Gradient Methods** — actor-critic algorithms
- **Model-Based RL** — predict future states

### Why We Didn't Include:

- Tabular Q-learning is sufficient for this problem size
- More advanced methods would need neural networks
- Goal was clean, understandable baseline (not SOTA)
- Diminishing returns for the added complexity

---

## Success Criteria

### You're Done When:

```
✅ Task 1 runs without errors
✅ Task 2 runs without errors
✅ Task 3 runs without errors
✅ Task 1 score > 0.80
✅ Task 2 score > 0.70
✅ Task 3 score > 0.60
✅ Code is clear and commented
✅ No hardcoded thresholds (all learned)
```

### Nice to Have:

```
⭐ All scores > 0.85
⭐ Code modified for your specific environment
⭐ Custom reward functions tested
⭐ Hyperparameters tuned per task
⭐ Documentation updated with results
```

- ✅ Exploration vs. Exploitation (epsilon-greedy)
- ✅ State discretization (feature engineering)
- ✅ Reward shaping (credit assignment)

### Multi-Objective Learning

- ✅ Balancing competing goals (safety vs. cost)
- ✅ Fairness constraints (social acceptability)
- ✅ Risk management (system collapse)
- ✅ Long-term planning (battery reserves)

### Real-World Decision Making

- ✅ Working with constraints (power available)
- ✅ Handling uncertainty (random demand)
- ✅ Enforcing policy (misuse detection)
- ✅ Maintaining trust (system reliability)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't

```python
# Hardcode thresholds instead of learning
if demand > 2.0:  # BAD: memorized pattern
    action = 3

# Over-weight one reward component
reward += violations * 100  # BAD: all other metrics ignored

# Train too short
train(episodes=50)  # BAD: not enough time to learn

# Lock in exploration too early
epsilon_decay = 0.99  # BAD: converges by ep 10

# Ignore system dynamics
supply = random.random() * 100  # BAD: no constraints
```

### Do

```python
# Let agent learn through experience
obs = self._augment_obs(obs)  # GOOD: rich features
action = agent.choose_action(obs)  # GOOD: agent decides

# Balance reward components
reward += ds * 4.0  # demand satisfaction
reward -= cost * 0.025  # cost penalty
reward -= violations * 3.0  # safety penalty
# All roughly comparable magnitude

# Train sufficiently
train(episodes=1000)  # GOOD: exploration time

# Decay slowly
epsilon_decay = 0.9975  # GOOD: 900+ exploration episodes

# Respect system constraints
power_remaining = total_power
for room in rooms:
    allocation = min(demand, power_remaining, cap)
    power_remaining -= allocation
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Score is 0.30 or lower"

→ Agent not learning. Check INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md section "Debugging Common Issues"

### "Score plateaus at 0.50"

→ Exploration too short. Increase epsilon_decay (make more aggressive)

### "Violations high (>20 in Task 1)"

→ Reward signal weak. Check: is priority violation penalty calculated? Try increasing to 5.0

### "Training very slow"

→ Replay buffer overhead. Reduce buffer size or increase batch updates.

### "Crashes after episode 200"

→ Agent diverging. Reduce alpha (learning rate) or increase epsilon_min
